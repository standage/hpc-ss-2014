## Prompt

> Describe why you want to participate in the summer school, what you expect to learn, how you plan to apply what you learn, and how you will share what you learn with others. Minimum of 300 words; maximum of 500 words.

## My response

My primary motivation for applying to this summer school is the opportunity to refresh my parallel programming skills and to reconsider how I might better leverage distributed-memory parallelization to improve the performance of my research software.

* passing complex data structures over MPI
* discussing my problems with MPI experts
* better management of trivially parallelizable tasks
* make code publicly available, generalizable (as evidenced by my current practice)

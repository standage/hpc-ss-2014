## My response

My primary motivation for attending this summer school is to improve upon my foundational skills in parallel programming, leveraging distributed-memory parallelization to investigate research problems that otherwise would be intractable.

Early in my graduate studies I completed coursework in parallel programming, which gave me my first substantial exposure to MPI programming. I wrote quite a bit of MPI software at the time, and have written an MPI program since then. However, I am approaching the limit of what I can accomplish with my current parallel programming experience, just as I am hoping to scale up my annotation capacity by 2-3 orders of magnitude. My expectation is that the skills I gain in the summer school will be be a critical component in my ability to successfully achieve my research aims.

I feel particularly limited by my rudimentary experience with inter-node communication, which is due in part to the fact that many of the problems I have heretofore worked on are trivial to parallelize. I understand the mechanics of message passing functions pretty well, and have used MPI derived data types to pass custom data structures between nodes. I hope that a better understanding of techniques and applications of message passing, and how to implement and/or utilize more advanced data structures in a parallel environment, will enable me to investigate protein-coding gene annotation at a very large scale, and to do so efficiently.

I am committed to open, transparent, reproducible research, and to observing established software engineering practices in tool development. Accordingly, I feel obligated to make the fruits of my research (including code, data, and interpretation) available to other scientist in a way that facilitates repurposing and reuse. In keeping with this philosophy, the code that I produce during this summer school, as well as the research software that I create and/or improve as a result of the summer school, will be available via public version control repositories under an unrestrictive open source license.

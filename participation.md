## My response

My primary motivation for attending this summer school is improve upon my foundational skills in parallel programming so that I can better leverage distributed-memory parallelization in my research.

Early in my graduate studies I completed coursework in parallel programming, which gave me my first substantial exposure to MPI programming. I wrote quite a bit of MPI software at the time, and have written an MPI program since then. However, my research interests and vision have matured considerably in the mean time, and I feel like I am not taking advantage of the full utility provided by MPI programming and supercomputing resources. I feel particularly limited by my rudimentary experience with inter-node communication, which is due in part to the fact that many of the problems I work on are trivial to parallelize. I understand the mechanics of message passing functions pretty well, and have used MPI derived data types to pass custom data structures between nodes. My hope is that programming exercises and discussions with MPI experts at this summer school will help me develop a better understanding of techniques and applications of message passing, and how to implement and/or utilize more advanced data structures in a parallel environment. This additional experience will enable me to leverage MPI to address research problems that are not as straightforward to parallelize.

I am committed to open, transparent, reproducible research, and to observing established software engineering practices in tool development. Accordingly, I feel obligated to make the fruits of my research (including code, data, and interpretation) available to other scientist in a way that facilitates repurposing and reuse. In keeping with this philosophy, the code that I produce during this summer school, as well as the research software that I create and/or improve as a result of the summer school, will be available via public version control repositories under an unrestrictive open source license.

My research interests are driven by the need to leverage large and complex genomic data sets to address fundamental questions in genome biology.

The escalating pace and decreasing cost with which genome-scale data can be produced and shared is exciting the imagination of scientists everywhere, who now have the ability to investigate their system(s) of interest at unprecedented scales. Raw data at these scales, however, are of little value until they can be accurately assembled, and assembled genome sequences are of little value without reliable annotation. This latter challenge--that of attaching descriptive annotations of genomic features to genome sequences--is the general focus of my research. In particular, I am interested in the annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic organisms.

Genome annotation continues to draw substantial community interest and research activity, not only because of the limited accuracy of current annotation technologies, but also because of the need to engineer more scalable workflows. Compounding this challenge is the increasing dimensionality and complexity of data available for analysis. We are moving beyond analysis of a single individual representative genome at a time to analysis of genomes and transcriptomes from different tissues & conditions, from different individuals, from different populations, and from different species.

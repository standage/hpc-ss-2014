My research interests are driven by the need to leverage large and complex genomic data sets to address fundamental questions in genome biology.

The escalating pace and decreasing cost with which genome-scale data can be produced and shared is exciting the imagination of scientists everywhere, who now have the ability to investigate their system(s) of interest at unprecedented scales. Raw data at these scales, however, are of little value until they can be accurately assembled, and assembled genome sequences are of little value without reliable annotation. This latter challenge--that of attaching descriptive annotations of genomic features to genome sequences--is the general focus of my research. In particular, I am interested in the annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic organisms.

Genome annotation continues to draw substantial community interest and research activity, not only because of the limited accuracy of current annotation technologies, but also because of the potential to integrate larger, richer, and more complex data sources. The availability of genome and transcriptome data for thousands of species, and for hundreds of individuals within each species, and for dozens of tissues or conditions per individual, forces us to change how we think about genomes and how we approach genome annotation. The depth of these data facilitate discerning technical assembly and annotation artifacts from true biological variations, and provide unparalleled utility for developing new more accurate models that leverage evolutionary and population genomic theory.

As this field matures, tasks related to genome annotation (making predictions, analyzing/interpreting predictions, managing data, etc) will depend increasingly on high-performance computing. Blah blah blah.

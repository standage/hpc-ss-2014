## My response

My research interests are driven by the need to leverage large and complex genomic data sets to address fundamental questions in genome biology.

The escalating pace and decreasing cost with which genome-scale data can be produced and shared is exciting the imagination of scientists everywhere, who now have the ability to investigate their system(s) of interest at unprecedented scales. Raw data at these scales, however, are of little value until they can be accurately assembled, and assembled genome sequences are of little value without reliable annotation. This latter challenge--that of attaching descriptive annotations of genomic features to genome sequences--is the general focus of my research. In particular, I am interested in the annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic organisms, using the primitively eusocial paper wasp _Polistes dominula_ as a model organism for the study of social behavior.

Genome annotation continues to draw substantial community interest and research activity, not only because of the limited accuracy of current annotation technologies, but also because of the potential to integrate larger, richer, and more complex data sources. Having focused my graduate research thus far primarily on a single insect genome, I'm eager to explore a fresh perspective on annotating genes in the context of hundreds or thousands of related genomes simultaneously. In such a context, the expensive and time-consuming approach of "finishing" each genome independently prior to comparative analysis simply cannot scale. Instead, the depth and richness of the data facilitate rapid identification of gene annotations across these genomes that are sufficiently reliable for downstream analysis of molecular evolution, gene regulation, gene expression, and a host of other important biological mechanisms. In addition to the 20-30 social insect genomes currently available for exploration of this technique, the i5K Initiative has begun the ambitious task of sequencing 5000 insect (and related arthropod) genomes for rapid release in the near future. Similar initiatives for genome and transcriptome sequencing in plants and humans are driving the need for annotation methodologies that can scale efficiently.

While the research problems that attract my interest are primarily biological, expertise with high-performance computing is critical for analysis, interpretation, and management of large genomic data sets. My research interests also include investigating best practices for leveraging cyberinfrastructure and HPC resources to address common issues in genome informatics.

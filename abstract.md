## My response

My research interests are driven by the need to leverage large and complex genomic data sets to address fundamental questions in genome biology.

The escalating pace and decreasing cost with which genome-scale data can be produced and shared is exciting the imagination of scientists everywhere, who now have the ability to investigate their system(s) of interest at unprecedented scales. Raw data at these scales, however, are of little value until they can be accurately assembled, and assembled genome sequences are of little value without reliable annotation. This latter challenge--that of attaching descriptive annotations of genomic features to genome sequences--is the general focus of my research. In particular, I am interested in the annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic organisms.

Genome annotation continues to draw substantial community interest and research activity, not only because of the limited accuracy of current annotation technologies, but also because of the potential to integrate larger, richer, and more complex data sources. The availability of genome and transcriptome data for thousands of species, and for hundreds of individuals within each species, and for dozens of tissues or conditions per individual, forces us to change how we think about genomes and how we approach genome annotation. The breadth and richness of these data enable bypassing the traditional prerequisite of "finishing" each genome assembly and annotation individually, facilitating rapid identification of gene annotations across these data sets that are sufficiently reliable for downstream analysis of molecular evolution, gene regulation, gene expression, and a host of other important biological mechanisms.

While the research problems that attract my interest are primarily biological, expertise with high-performance computing is critical for analysis, interpretation, and management of large genomic data sets. My research interests also include investigating better ways to leverage cyberinfrastructure and HPC resources to address common issues in genome informatics.
